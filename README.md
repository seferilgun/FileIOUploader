# FileIOUploader
This project is a file sharing and upload platform that utilizes the File.io API. File.io is a cloud storage service that allows you to securely and quickly share files. In this project, we provide a web interface where users can easily upload and share their files.

Our project is developed using the PHP language and designed with the Bootstrap framework. Users can select and upload files through the web interface. Once the upload process is complete, users are provided with a download link and information about the file's expiration date.

Additionally, during the upload process, users are presented with a loading animation. This animation visually represents the file upload progress and allows users to track the progress of their uploads.

The project setup is straightforward. Simply deploy the project to a web server and install the necessary dependencies. Then, integrate your File.io API key into the project to start using the service.

Our project offers a simple and user-friendly solution that enables users to share their files quickly and securely. By improving the file sharing and upload experience, we aim to enhance the overall user experience.
